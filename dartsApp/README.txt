This application is the final project for the course 
"Python Web Service From Idea to Production" by Tero Karvinen.

DartsApp is a simple score-keeping application for the game of Darts,
where users register and log in, and may then create their score-keepers.
Adding to the score update -function automatically calculates the
remaining required points to win.

This application is in Alpha phase of its software release life cycle.
Therefore some functionalities are missing due to time constraints.

In the near-future I might update the score-keeper to include the missing
functions.

Playable demo is available for testing at http://139.162.154.116/ for at
least the duration of the course. There is no guarantee of the server
staying live after 2.6.2021.
